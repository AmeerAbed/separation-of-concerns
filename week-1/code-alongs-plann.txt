isolating js
  program life-cycle
    - no code-alongs, just a pytut link
  errors
    - use errors to introduce the life-cycle stages?
    - the embedded code-along is helpful
      asserts before a syntax error won't be asserted
  primitive types & values
    - console.assert typeofs
  strict comparison
  type casting
  variables
  functions
  block scope
  conditionals

integrating js
  introduce the roles
  show two projects being built
  show two fully separated projects
  do a code-along


isolating rethink
  program life-cycle & errors
    explicitly teach how to read the callstack
    firefox doesn't log callstack, this is a live-server thing?
  true, false & asserting
    have them see that only failing asserts log to the console
  ===, !==, &&, ||, !
  primitive-types-values
