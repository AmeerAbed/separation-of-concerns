# Week 2: Step Through

This week you should focus on using different techniques to pause and step through your code.  JS Tutor is an outstanding tool to study and learn JavaScript in isolation. You should be using it every hour of every day! Even after graduating HYF and beginning your professional experience, JS Tutor will still be a useful tool for learning and debugging. But it is limited to studying JavaScript in isolated snippets.

To step through and debug your code while it is integrated into your weekly projects, you will need to learn how to use the browser's debugging tools.  This includes: the `debugger` statement, _break points_, step buttons, hovering values, and the memory panel.  Your DevTools' debugger is a complicated tool.  There is _a lot_ of information and _so many_ buttons, it will take time before you are comfortable using it.  But without practice you'll never get there! So start soon and practice often, your future self will thank you.

## Assignments

This week there is a change in the way we are dealing with homework. During the week you are now expected to spend most of your time studying and mastering the basics of JavaScript. We will use class time to learn how these basic skills fit together to solve more complex problems and to build real projects.

So what does this mean for your studying?

It means you should now focus first on the _Isolating JavaScript_ exercises, spending lots of time learning the basics of JavaScript.  Only move on to the _integration_ exercises and the project mid-week when you are feeling comfortable with the basics.

It also means that you are no longer expected to finish the projects on your own over the week. You are still expected to move your homework issues into "READY FOR REVIEW" by Friday so your coaches know how you are doing, but the project does not need to be finished!

Coaches will be using your homework submissions to assess what skills or concepts are causing the most difficulties so they can plan the best way to help you all on Sunday.

### Exercises


#### Isolating JavaScript

* Continue the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises
  * Sign into FreeCodeCamp using your GitHub Account
  * Turn on your Public Profile
  * Complete [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/) up through [Iterate with JS do ... while loops](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-do...while-loops)
* Fork [JS Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/)
  * Solve the Exercises in the folders called `week-1` and `week-1-practice`
  * You will need to run these exercises [in Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY), but don't be intimidated!  This is actually a very simple way to run your code.  With a little practice using `cd` and `ls` from the command line you'll be good to go!
  * VSC comes built-in with a very good [JavaScript debugger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY) that will help you to step through your code and understand what is happening inside your program.  At first this will be a bit intimidating, but soon you'll wonder how you ever programmed without it.
