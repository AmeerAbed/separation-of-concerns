# Week 2: Step Through

This week you should focus on using different techniques to pause and step through your code.  JS Tutor is an outstanding tool to study and learn JavaScript in isolation. You should be using it every hour of every day! Even after graduating HYF and beginning your professional experience, JS Tutor will still be a useful tool for learning and debugging. But it is limited to studying JavaScript in isolated snippets.

To step through and debug your code while it is integrated into your weekly projects, you will need to learn how to use the browser's debugging tools.  This includes: the `debugger` statement, _break points_, step buttons, hovering values, and the memory panel.  Your DevTools' debugger is a complicated tool.  There is _a lot_ of information and _so many_ buttons, it will take time before you are comfortable using it.  But without practice you'll never get there! So start soon and practice often, your future self will thank you.
