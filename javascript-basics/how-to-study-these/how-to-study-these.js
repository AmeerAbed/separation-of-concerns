//   commenting code
//   pay attention to the symbols on the left of the editor
//   your work will not be saved, this is good! practice these till you have them memorized!
//     these are fundamental skills & concepts in JS.
//     don't treat these exercises as problems to be solved, but as skills to be mastered
//   if you want, you can study all of these snippets anywhere javascript runs.  they'd be a nice intro to node
//   if you want, you can use console.log to print values to the console
//     but that i not encouraged.  these exercises are built around console.assert for a reason
//     practice _predicting_ and _testing_ code with assert
//     instead of just describing it logs




// The files of code in this directory are all nothing more than files plain JavaScript code.  You can study them anywhere JavaScript will run!

// * Copy-pasted in the browser console
// * embedded in the weekly lesson plans
// * in Node.js
// * ... do you know of any other places you can run these files?

// your work will not be saved!  this is on purpose.  these exercises are meant to be studied and practiced repeatedly until you can easily solve them.  passing them once is not enough!  repetition repetition repetition.
// you should practice them until they are easy
