execution phase & creation phase

pay attention to the symbols on the left of the editor
reading error messages & finding the error


reading errors

* open the console (along the bottom is nice)
* if the error was caught in creation phase, look for a red x next to it in the editor
  * there will not be a helpful line number in the console
* if the error was caught during execution phase
  * you should see in the console the same error printed as you see under the 'evaluate' button
  * the first line under the error will starte with have the word 'editor'
  * now go to the far right of that line and you'll see two numbers x:y
  * those numbers are the line number & charecter number where the error occurred
