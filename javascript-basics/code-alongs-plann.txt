isolating js
  program life-cycle
    - no code-alongs, just a pytut link
  errors
    - use errors to introduce the life-cycle stages?
    - the embedded code-along is helpful
      asserts before a syntax error won't be asserted
  primitive types & values
    - console.assert typeofs
  strict comparison
  type casting
  variables
  functions
  block scope
  conditionals

integrating js
  introduce the roles
  show two projects being built
  show two fully separated projects
  do a code-along


isolating rethink
  z. how to use these exercises
  0. program life-cycle & errors
    explicitly teach how to read the callstack
    firefox doesn't log callstack, this is a live-server thing?
  1. comparisons and logic
    asserting
    logical operators
    strict comparisons
    order of operations
    pass the tests
  2. primitive-types-values
    typeof, type names are strings, challenges
    strings, quotes in quotes
    numbers
    boolean, undefined & null
    pass the tests
