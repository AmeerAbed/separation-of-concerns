// your work will not be saved, this is good!
// study these examples & exercises till you have them memorized
// these are fundamental skills and concepts to be mastered
//  not problems to be solved and forgotten


// study every example and exercise in JS Tutor
// this is so important that there's a button for it!
// so no excuses.  study everything in JS Tutor, always


// If you're feeling comfortable with the exercises
// and are looking for an extra challenge
//  try studying them other ways!

// because they are plain js files with no dependencies
//  you can study them anywhere you can run JS code
// try these on for size:

// - save your progress as snippets in Chrome/ium
// https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/snippets

// - clone the repo and run them with VSC/Node.js
