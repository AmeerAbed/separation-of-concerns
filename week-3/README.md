## Prep Work

### Sunday Lesson Plan

Study the [Sunday lesson plan](https://hackyourfuture.be/separation-of-concerns/week-3) so you come prepared. It's not possible to learn everything in 4 hours, the more prepared you are the more you will benefit from class!

### special topic/s

### Isolating JavaScript

* Objects: [javascript.info/type-conversions](https://javascript.info/type-conversions)
* Arrays: [javascript.info/operators](https://javascript.info/operators)
* Iterating Objects & Arrays: [javascript.info/while-for](https://javascript.info/while-for) and complete the tasks
* Arrow Functions - same idea, different spelling: [javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics)

## Assignments

During the week you are expected to spend most of your time studying and mastering the basics of JavaScript. We will use class time to learn how these basic skills fit together to solve more complex problems and to build real projects.

So what does this mean for your studying?

It means you should now focus first on the _Isolating JavaScript_ exercises, spending lots of time learning the basics of JavaScript.  Only move on to the the project and integration exercises  mid-week when you are feeling comfortable with the basics.

You are not required to finish the projects on your own over the week, but don't let this stop you from trying! You are expected to move your homework issues into "READY FOR REVIEW" by Friday so your coaches know how you are doing, but the project does not need to be finished.

Coaches will be using your homework submissions to assess what skills or concepts are causing the most difficulties so they can plan the best way to help you all on Sunday.

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* Continue the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises
  * Sign into FreeCodeCamp using your GitHub Account
  * Turn on your Public Profile
  * Complete [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/)
  * Complete the [_Debugging_ challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/) from FreeCodeCamp
  * Complete [Basic Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/)
* Fork [JS Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/)
  * Solve the Exercises in the folders called `week-2`, `week-2-practice`, `week-3`, and `week-3-practice`.
  * You will need to run these exercises [in Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY), but don't be intimidated!  This is actually a very simple way to run your code.  With a little practice using `cd` and `ls` from the command line you'll be good to go!
  * VSC comes built-in with a very good [JavaScript debugger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY) that will help you to step through your code and understand what is happening inside your program.  At first this will be a bit intimidating, but soon you'll wonder how you ever programmed without it.

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Fork [listeners-and-handlers](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/listeners-and-handlers)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* [handler-refactors](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/handler-refactors)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!

### Project

> [Starter Code](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is again to create 5 functions that users can interact with from the browser using [prompt and alert](https://javascript.info/alert-prompt-confirm). To get started [fork this repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/soc-week-3-project), clone it and open the code in VSC.  Here are some tips:

* Open the `index.html` in your browser and open your console.  This is how you'll know if your asserts pass and if there are any errors!
* Go back and forth between VSC and your browser very often.  Every time you make a change in the code, refresh in the browser to test your code and check for any errors.
* Work in small steps.  First pass all of the asserts, then move on to completing the 3 incomplete handlers.  You can always call your functions directly from the console without using the handlers.

Besides passing the tests, this week you should spend plenty of time practicing [stepping through in the debugger](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome).  The starter code has `debugger` statements already in place to pause your website when each challenge is loaded, and each time a user clicks a button. It might feel a bit slow, but do take the time to step through the test cases and user interactions. Tracing execution like this will help you to understand working with arrays & objects, how functions work, and how the logic of your solution works.  You should especially step through your code _before_ you have passed the tests!  The debugger is there to help you understand what your code _does_ do (instead of what you _want_ it to do) and to find your mistakes.

Your completed project repository must contain:

1. A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
1. One branch per file in the `challenges` folder.
1. A live demo with: 0 failing asserts, 5 working buttons
