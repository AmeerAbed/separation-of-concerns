## Prep Work

### Sunday Lesson Plan

Study the [Sunday lesson plan](https://hackyourfuture.be/separation-of-concerns/week-3) so you come prepared. It's not possible to learn everything in 4 hours, the more prepared you are the more you will benefit from class!

## Assignments

During the week you are expected to spend most of your time studying and mastering the basics of JavaScript. We will use class time to learn how these basic skills fit together to solve more complex problems and to build real projects.

So what does this mean for your studying?

It means you should now focus first on the _Isolating JavaScript_ exercises, spending lots of time learning the basics of JavaScript.  Only move on to the the project and integration exercises  mid-week when you are feeling comfortable with the basics.

You are not required to finish the projects on your own over the week, but don't let this stop you from trying! You are expected to move your homework issues into "READY FOR REVIEW" by Friday so your coaches know how you are doing, but the project does not need to be finished.

Coaches will be using your homework submissions to assess what skills or concepts are causing the most difficulties so they can plan the best way to help you all on Sunday.

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.


### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* Continue the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises
  * Sign into FreeCodeCamp using your GitHub Account
  * Turn on your Public Profile
  * Complete [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/)
  * Complete the [_Debugging_ challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/) from FreeCodeCamp
* Fork [JS Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/)
  * Solve the Exercises in the folders called `week-2`, `week-2-practice`, `week-3`, and `week-3-practice`.
  * You will need to run these exercises [in Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY), but don't be intimidated!  This is actually a very simple way to run your code.  With a little practice using `cd` and `ls` from the command line you'll be good to go!
  * VSC comes built-in with a very good [JavaScript debugger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY) that will help you to step through your code and understand what is happening inside your program.  At first this will be a bit intimidating, but soon you'll wonder how you ever programmed without it.

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Fork [listeners-and-handlers](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/listeners-and-handlers)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* [handler-refactors](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/handler-refactors)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
